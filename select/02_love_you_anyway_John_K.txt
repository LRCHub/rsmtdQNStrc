There's parts of you that you keep from me
Very deep, too far down to reach
The skeletons that you're scared I'll see
So, you keep running and running and running from me
You tell me I shouldn't love you
Tell me I shouldn't fall
Show me all of your scars and the beautiful parts that you call your flaws
Tell me I shouldn't be here
But I don't care what you say
Darling, watch me, watch me, watch me love you anyway
You tell me stories from your past, oh
Think forever will never last, oh, oh
Oh, and I understand if it's hard for you to trust
When you open your heart and get hurt by someone
You tell me I shouldn't love you
Tell me I shouldn't fall
Show me all of your scars and the beautiful parts that you call your flaws
Tell me I shouldn't be here
But I don't care what you say
Darling, watch me, watch me, watch me love you anyway
Oh, oh
Oh, oh—oh
Darling, watch me, watch me, watch me love you anyway
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, whoa
Through the storm in your head, let me be your shelter, yeah
Put your heart in my hands and your hand on my shoulder
Oh, 'cause when I'm looking at you, I can see forever
So go ahead, go ahead, and tell me I shouldn't love you
Tell me I shouldn't fall
Show me all of your scars and the beautiful parts that you call your flaws
Tell me I shouldn't be here
But I don't care what you say
Darling, watch me, watch me, watch me love you anyway
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh
Oh, oh—oh
Darling, watch me, watch me, watch me love you anyway (oh, oh—oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh (baby, yeah)
Oh, oh—oh (oh, oh)
Darling, watch me, watch me, watch me love you anyway
Darling, watch me, watch me, watch me love you anyway
