You were the light that wounds the eye
The pain that time could not deny
I felt resistance fading fast
As if you saved the heart for last
I knew right then no matter what
This would take all that I've got
There's really nothing I could do
Oh, this much in love with you
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway
I toss and turn helplessly
There's nothin' no one can do for me
You're the first thought in my soul
There's no regaining my control
And should one day I stand accused
By other loves I have refused
When hope is gone and I am weak
You are the last name I will speak
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway
