What do you want from me?
I ain't nothin' left to give
What would you like to see?
A broken heart? Please spare me

Cause I could be sad and cry
And my brother will wonder why
You don't realize I understand
What it meant when you pushed away my hand
My hand

Where do you stand with me?
Lord knows, Lord knows
Where would you like to be?
In my life? Please spare me

Cause I could be sad and cry
And my brother will wonder why
You don't realize that I understand
What I meant when you pushed away my hand
My hand

I still love you anyway
But it's of no use, no use without you babe
I still love you anyway but it's
No use, no use
No use
What do you want from me?
I told you a thousand times I have nothin' left to give
And what do you need from me?
Nothin' so please leave and let me live

Cause I could be sad and cry
And my brother will wonder why
You don't realize that I understand
What it meant when you took away my hand
My hand

I still love you anyway, but it's
No no use, no use without you baby
I still love you anyway but it's
No no no use, no use whith out you baby

I still love you anyway,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's no no no
No no no no no no no use without you baby
I still love you anyway, but it's
No use, no use
Whith out you baby
