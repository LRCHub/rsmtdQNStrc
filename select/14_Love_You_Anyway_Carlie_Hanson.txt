It takes two to realize what we've become
Hearing both sides, they both sound wrong
It's true
You're a piece of shit, too
And that face you wear when we both go out
You hiding something you keep way down
Don't front
Someday, I'll have to let up

Even when I'd rather be lonely
Medicate and detonate slowly
I'm sick of trying to figure you out
And it's all too much to take
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway

Remember that day you got kicked out
I held your hand like a little child
I've been
The only one in your head
And I know we said that we'd start brand new
Kick and punch, but we can't break through
It's fine
Maybe we'll get it next time

Even when I'd rather be lonely
Medicate and detonate slowly
I'm sick of trying to figure you out
And it's all too much to take
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
I think I love you anyway
