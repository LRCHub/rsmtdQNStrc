# The Marías – Love You Anyway

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Wake up (Wake up)
Just to see your face
Just to see your face
Stay up (Stay up)
With you every day
(With you every day)
Got to (Got to, got to)
Find a better way
(Find a better way)
To tell you (Tell you, tell you)
Before I run away
(Before I run away, oh)
Maybe I may never find the words
to say
Wait another lifetime
so that I could stay
I know that you've always
been in love with me
But I know that you've also
had to watch me leave
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
I said it
I'm in love with you
(I'm in love with you)
But I can't (I can't)
Tell you what to do
Tell you what to do
And oh my God,
what a waste of breath
Wanna live with me
and replace the rest
So I won't ever breakdown
Maybe I may never find the words
to say
Wait another lifetime
so that I could stay
I know that you've always
been in love with me
But I know that you've also
had to watch me leave
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
